KyloDocs<br>Version 1.2.1

KyloDocs is a simple NoSQL utility for Ruby that attempts to make database management easier for you by making language do all the guess work for you.


###Versions

The current version of KyloDocs has two interpretations:

```
Version Production.Development.Patch
or
Version Release.Beta.Alpha
```

For this reason, if the newest version has only gone up by 0.0.1, update at your own risk. It would be best to at least wait for it to increment by 0.1.0.
